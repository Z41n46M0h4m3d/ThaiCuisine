    <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable or conola oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into small dices</li>
        <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp soysauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp toasted seseme oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and white pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>If using day-old rice (see note), transfer to a medium bowl and break the rice up with your hands into individual grains before proceeding. Heat 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) vegetable oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until the rice is pale brown and toasted and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice.</li>
        <li>Return all the rice to the wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil to the space. Add onion, carrot, scallions, and garlic and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss with rice to combine. Add soy sauce and sesame oil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Push rice to the side of the wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil. Break the egg into the oil and season with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss the egg and the rice together.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately!</li>
