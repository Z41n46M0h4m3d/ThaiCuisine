    <p>The orange coloured sweet concoction is so good it feels like it should be dessert.</p>

    <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp Thai Tea leaves</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp evaporated milk</li>
        <li>A lot of ice</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Steep Thai tea leaves in the hot water for 3-5 minutesâ€”you can steep the tea in a cloth filter bag (as shown in video) or just in a cup and then pour it through a paper filter.</li>
        <li>While the tea steeps, combine condensed milk, sugar, salt in a mixing glass. Once the tea is ready, pour the brewed tea into the glass and stir to dissolve the sugar and condensed milk.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, fill a glass all the way to the top with ice and pour in the mixed tea, leaving a little room on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the top with some evaporated milk and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
